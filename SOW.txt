i'd like to see the distribution of male and female, and their age groups
i'd also like to see the distribution of race for each channel
- for FY16 
- for june16

i'd like to see the changes in distribution 
- between financial year FY15(30june14- 29june15) and FY16 
- between june15 vs june16

my initial thoughts were to just have histograms or boxplots, but if you have any suggestions to visualise the data, please let me know!

the columns represent the different demographic groups
a15-49 
a4+ 
mym4-14 
myw4-14 
mym15-24 
myw15-24 
mym25-34 
myw25-34 
mym35-49 
myw35-49 
mym50+ 
myw50+ 
**eg myw50+ is woman 50+ year old, mym50+ is male 50+yo
